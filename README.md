# 🌊 Web3 Lab 🧪

Welcome to the **Web3-Lab** — a deep dive into the ocean of blockchain, where smart contracts swim, dApps sail, and discoveries bubble up from the depths.

This is my underwater zone to:

- 🐠 Learn and experiment with **Solidity** smart contracts
- 🐚 Explore and recreate cool **blockchain tutorials**
- 🐙 Log daily dives of what I discover
- 🐬 Build wave-making dApps

## 🌊 Folder Currents

### `smart-contracts-playgorund/`

> A reef of Solidity contracts — from tiny fish scripts to whale-sized logic.  
> This is where syntax swims, bugs get caught, and wild blockchain creatures are born.

### `blockchain-playground/`

> Dive into NFT minting tools, decentralized treasure hunts, and more.  
> It’s hands-on, messy, and sometimes electrifying like an eel.
